    "Welcome to Analyzing the CPS ASEC! In this lab, we will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks and the tools that you are going to use to conduct your data analysis of the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). In the main part of this notebook, you will work with the CPS ASEC dataset using this Jupyter Notebook and learn how to read tabular datasets, interpret data visualizations, and compare various economic indicators. By the end of this notebook, you will also apply your knowledge to answer a set of short answer questions. \n",

    "**Jupyter notebooks** are documents that can contain a seamless compilation of text, code, visualizations, and more. A notebook is composed of two types of rectangular **cells**:  markdown and code. A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text. A **code cell** contains code. All of the code in this notebook is in a programming language called **Python**. You can select any cell by clicking it once. After a cell is selected, you can navigate the notebook using the up and down arrow keys or by simply scrolling.\n",

    "- click the Run button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. \n",

    "If a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (\\*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number corresponding to the order in which the cell was run will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell."

Text in Markdown cells is written in [**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a formatting syntax for plain text, so you may see some funky symbols when you edit a text cell. Once you've made your changes, you can exit text editing mode by running the cell. Edit the next cell to fix the misspelling."

You can save the notebook in its current state by clicking `Control-S`/`Command-S`, clicking the **floppy disc icon** in the toolbar at the top of the page, or by navigating to **File > Save and Checkpoint** in the menu bar.\n",

You can get the functions and variables back by re-running the cells where they were defined â€“ the easiest way is to **highlight the cell where you left off work, then go to Cell > Run all above** in the menu bar. You can also use this menu to run all cells in the notebook by clicking **Run all**."
