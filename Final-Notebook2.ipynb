In this lab, we will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks and the tools that you are going to use to conduct your data analysis of data from the American Community Survey (ACS). In the main part of this notebook, you will work with the ACS dataset using this Jupyter Notebook and learn how to read tabular datasets, interpret data visualizations, and compare various economic indicators. By the end of this notebook, you will also apply your knowledge to answer a set of short answer questions.\n",

All of the code in this notebook is in a programming language called **Python**. You can select any cell by clicking it once. After a cell is selected, you can navigate the notebook using the up and down arrow keys or by simply scrolling.\n",

    "The long tail in our violin plots mean that there are some people whose income reached those values. For example, for those self-employed workers who completed college, we can see that the tail of our violin plot reaches above 100,000. This means that there are some self-employed workers who completed college and are at or above an income of 100K. However, since this violin plot has most of its mass within the 0-20k income range, this scenario is not very likely, as the distribution of income is mostly found within the 0-20K range. \n",
