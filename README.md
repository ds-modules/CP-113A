Welcome to Analyzing the ACS! In this lab, we will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks and the tools that you are going to use to conduct your data analysis of the American Community Survey (ACS). In the main part of this notebook, you will learn how to read tabular datasets, interpret data visualizations, and compare various economic indicators.
